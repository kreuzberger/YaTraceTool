YaTraceTool
===========

Trace / Logging Library in C++ Local or via Network 

The YaTraceTool supports in tracing message from differen applications by sending them to a central
server instance which collects the individual messages. An GUI application is also provided to connect
to the server and view and filter the messages.

Message filtering is not only done on the gui side, the filters are send to the local applications to reduce
application load and to enable / disable filters at runtime.

The YaTraceTools also supports the definition of callbacks, which can be called by the GUI application to
execute actions in the application. Also provides parameters for the callbacks. This supports at early points
of your development if triggers or interfaces to your application cannot be served by a gui or other applications.

YaTraceTool required QT for build and at runtime (for lib, server and gui).

Contains:

* TraceLib: C++ Library for binding to your application to receive trace messages and handle callback
* TraceServer: Network Server for central collection of trace messages from applications
* TraceClient: GUI Application for connection to a trace server. Shows Messages, apply filters and execute callbacks
